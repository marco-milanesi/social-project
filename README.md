## Minigrid
* * *
<div align = left>

The <a href="https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid">Minigrid</a> library contains a collection of discrete grid-world environments to conduct research on Reinforcement Learning. To **install** the Minigrid library use `pip install minigrid`.

### Environments
The included environments can be divided in two groups. The original Minigrid environments and the BabyAI environments. For this project the first one were chosen: these environments have in common a triangle-like agent with a discrete action space that has to navigate a 2D map with different obstacles (Walls, Lava, Dynamic obstacles) depending on the environment. The task to be accomplished is described by a mission string returned by the observation of the agent. 

### Setup
The notebook is available here, as presented in the first section, the following commands to install the packages have to be run:

```
pip install gym==0.22
pip install gym-minigrid==1.0.0
```
